        <p class="font-light">
          ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm <strong>Joy Paulsen</strong>, a data scientist,
          engineer, and creative technologist based in Minneapolis, MN. I care
          deeply about building things that matter with precision and quality.

          <!-- especially when it comes to <strong
            >climate</strong
          >, <strong>sustainability</strong>, and using <strong>data</strong> to
          drive positive change. -->

        <p class="font-light">
          I'm currently a Lead Data Scientist working in personalization and
          machine learning at Target. Outside of the 9-5, my other professional
          interests include mission-driven work focused on the <strong
            >energy transition</strong
          >, <strong>sustainability</strong>, and <strong>climate action</strong
          >.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Work</h2>

        <p class="font-light">
          My team at Target builds automated systems to classify products into
          semantically meaningful themes. Previously, I worked on a
          cross-functional team developing performant streaming applications for
          real-time inference that was used to enhance web and mobile UX.
          Additionally, I have worked on both traditional and deep
          learning-based recommendation systems integrated into several
          different products during my time at Target.
        </p>

        <p class="font-light">
          Before that, I was a member of the wonderful data science team at C.H.
          Robinson, a third-party logistics (3PL) provider. I ended my time
          there leading a team focused on building fast recommentation systems
          and search engine capabilities for their flagship app. I started my
          first few years there focusing on time-series analysis, pricing, and
          demand forecasting.
