          I'm currently a Lead Data Scientist working on machine learning and AI
          at Target. Outside of the 9-5, some of my other professional interests
          include science communication, data visualization, and mission-driven
          work focused on sustainability, energy, and climate. I have recently
          started a blog to explore these topics in more depth, which you can

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Work</h2>

        <p class="font-light">
          My team at Target builds automated systems to classify products into
          semantically meaningful themes. Previously, I worked on a
          cross-functional team developing performant streaming applications for
          real-time inference that was used to enhance web and mobile UX.
          Additionally, I have worked on both traditional and deep
          learning-based recommendation systems integrated into several
          different products during my time at Target.
        </p>

        <p class="font-light">
          Before that, I was a member of the data science group at C.H.
          Robinson, a third-party logistics (3PL) provider. I ended my time
          there leading a team focused on building recommentation systems and
          search engine capabilities for their flagship app. My first few years
          centered around time-series analysis, pricing forecasts, and market
          dynamics.
